  \ known as the \"International Subversives\".\nAnthrax, another Australian hacker\
  \ and phreaker\n\nThe book also mentions other hackers who had contacts with the\
  \ protagonists, among them Erik Bloodaxe of the Legion of Doom and Corrupt of the\

  \ and reactions of the computer security community to the WANK worm that attacked\
  \ DEC VMS computers over the DECnet in 1989 and was purportedly coded by a Melbourne\
  \ hacker.\nThe book has sold 10,000 copies as of 2010. The author made the electronic\
  \ edition of the book freely available in 2001, when it was announced on Slashdot,\

  \ 400,000 downloads within two years. The original download site www.underground-book.com\
  \ was taken over in 2008 and now offers a link to Amazon where copies of the book\
  \ may still be available. The site www.underground-book.net has the book freely\
  \ available in electronic form.\nThe 2002 documentary In the Realm of the Hackers,\
  \ directed by Kevin Anderson and centered on Phoenix and Electron, was inspired\
  \ by this book.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
